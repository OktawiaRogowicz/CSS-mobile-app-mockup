### What I learned
It's the first time I've had used local storage, allowing the user to save his score between next attempts of playing the game. As I mentioned above, I also kept mobile first design in mind, which was not as hard to do as I expected - and even though desktop version needs little more polishing, I am happy with the results.

### Continued development
Even though game might be finished, I do not consider this project done: even though few of the used design choices work, I am not happy with them and would love them to be improved. Especially animation of winning, as I wanted to have the same effect applied not only while winning, but also when picking the initial symbol. Turns out activating ::before and ::after effects was way more complicated that I firstly thought!
